 * NOTES: Jp Comments
 *  Typically, when you create a new class, good coding style is to have comments at the top of the class to explain how
 *  it's used, where it's used, etc...
 *
 * You'll want to set up the properties, methods, etc... for the classes (which you'll continue to learn about in this
